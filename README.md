# Coding Task Name: Holiday Calculations
# Coding Task description: The task is to calculate a user’s total holiday cost, which includes the plane cost, hotel cost, and car rental cost.
#  Get the user inputs 
#       city_flight: The city they will be flying to (you can create some options for them. Remember, each city will have different flight costs).
#       num_nights: The number of nights they will be staying at a hotel.
#       rental_days: The number of days for which they will be hiring a car.
# ○ hotel_cost(): This function will take num_nights as an argument and
# return a total cost for the hotel stay (you can choose the price per night
# charged at the hotel).
# ○ plane_cost(): This function will take city_flight as an argument and
# return a cost for the flight. Hint: use if/else statements in the function to
# retrieve a price based on the chosen city.
# ○ car_rental(): This function will take rental_days as an argument and
# return the total cost of the car rental (you can choose the daily rental
# cost).
# ○ holiday_cost(): This function takes three arguments: num_nights,
# city_flight, and rental_days. Using these three arguments, call the
# hotel_cost(), plane_cost(), and car_rental() functions with their
# respective arguments, and finally return the total cost for the holiday.
# Finally, Print out all the details about the holiday in a way that is easy to read.
